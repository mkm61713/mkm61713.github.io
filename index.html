	    <p>I started taking photos back in middle school and have continued
	      doing it until today. My favorite type of photography is nature.
	      The type of camera I own is a Canon Rebel T3i.

	      There are three important things you need to know about the camera
	      in order to maximize your photo taking skills.</p></div>
