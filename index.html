		<p>Photography is the art of taking photos. I started taking photos back in middle school and have continued
		doing it until today. My favorite type of photography is nature.
		The type of camera I own is a Canon Rebel T3i.

		...
		There are three important things you need to know about the camera
		in order to maximize your photo taking skills.</p>

				<th>What it's called</th><th>What it does</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Aperature</td><td>This refers to how much light you let in to the camera. This is measured in f-stops.
				If you have a high f-stop, you are letting in less light, and thus you will have more of
				the photograph in focus. With a smaller f-stop, you are letting in less light and only focusing
				on one object.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Exposure</td><td>This refers to how much light your shot is exposed to.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Shutter Speed</td><td>This refers to how long the shutter is left open. There are fast shutter
				speeds which allow you to take action shots. There are long exposure shots that can take a minute long
				which people use for landscapes, such as waterfalls.</td>
