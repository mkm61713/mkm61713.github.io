	<h1>PHOTOGRAPHY</h1>
	
		<h2 style ="text-align:center">	Photography is one of my favorite hobbies. I started taking photos back in middle school
			and have continued doing it until today. My favorite type of photography is nature. 
			The type of camera I own is a Canon Rebel T3i. </h2>

			<div class ="ugh">
			<p>There are three important things I learned that 
			I need to use in order to become a better photographer and optimize my photo taking skills. They are aperture., ISO, and shutter speed. 
			This table explains what they are:</p></div>
		
			<div class="help">
			<table border="1" table style ="width: 740px">
				<tr>
				<th></th><th>What it does</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Aperture</td><td>This refers to how much light you let in to the camera. This is measured in f-stops.
				If you have a high f-stop, you are letting in less light, and thus you will have more of
				the photograph in focus. With a smaller f-stop, you are letting in less light and only focusing
				on one object.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Exposure</td><td>This refers to how much light your shot is exposed to.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td>Shutter Speed</td><td>This refers to how long the shutter is left open. There are fast shutter
				speeds which allow you to take action shots. There are long exposure shots that can take a minute long
				which people use for landscapes, such as waterfalls.</td>
				</tr>
