    <p>I started taking photos back in middle school and have continued
      doing it until today. My favorite type of photography is nature.
      The type of camera I own is a Canon Rebel T3i.
	    
      There are three important things you need to know about the camera
      in order to maximize your photo taking skills.</p>
